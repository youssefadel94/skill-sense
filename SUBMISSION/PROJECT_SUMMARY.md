# SkillSense - AI-Powered Skill Portfolio & Career Intelligence Platform

## Project Summary

**SkillSense** is an intelligent career development platform that automatically extracts, analyzes, and visualizes professional skills from multiple sources using Google Vertex AI. Unlike traditional resume builders, SkillSense creates a dynamic, AI-powered skill profile by analyzing your GitHub repositories, LinkedIn profile, and uploaded CVs to provide actionable career insights.

**The Problem:** Professionals struggle to maintain an accurate inventory of their skills, understand market trends, identify skill gaps for target roles, and generate compelling CVs that reflect their true capabilities. Manual skill tracking is time-consuming and often incomplete.

**Our Solution:** SkillSense leverages Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model through Vertex AI to:
- **Extract skills automatically** from code repositories, professional profiles, and documents
- **Analyze skill gaps** by comparing your profile against target job roles
- **Generate AI-powered CVs** with dynamic content based on extracted skills
- **Provide market intelligence** showing skill demand trends and salary ranges
- **Recommend learning paths** personalized to your career goals
- **Enable semantic search** using Weaviate vector database for intelligent skill matching

**Key Impact:** Users can discover 50+ skills they didn't know they had, receive personalized recommendations for career advancement, and generate professional CVs in seconds. The platform reduces career planning time by 80% while providing data-driven insights for strategic skill development.

**Tech Highlight:** Built with Angular 17, NestJS, Google Vertex AI (Gemini 2.0), Firebase, and Weaviate vector database for production-ready, scalable career intelligence.
