# SkillSense - AI-Powered Skill Intelligence Platform

## Project Summary (250 words)

**SkillSense** is an AI-powered career intelligence platform that automatically extracts, analyzes, and optimizes professional skills from multiple sources including GitHub repositories, LinkedIn profiles, and uploaded CVs. Built for Hack Nation 2025, SkillSense addresses the critical challenge of skill visibility and career advancement in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape.

**The Problem:** Professionals struggle to effectively showcase their complete skill set across fragmented platforms. Traditional resume formats fail to capture the depth of technical expertise demonstrated through actual code contributions, open-source work, and continuous learning.

- **Multi-Source Integration:** Connects GitHub, LinkedIn, and parses uploaded CVs to build a comprehensive skill profile

- **Vector Search:** Implements Weaviate vector database for semantic skill matching and discovery
- **Intelligent CV Generation:** Creates dynamic, role-targeted resumes using AI to emphasize relevant competencies
- **Career Intelligence:** Provides skill gap analysis, personalized learning paths, and market trend insights

**Impact:** SkillSense transforms how professionals present their expertise and how organizations discover talent. By automating skill extraction and providing data-driven career guidance, we enable better job matches, faster hiring decisions, and targeted professional development.
